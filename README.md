## Project Pizza

In this project we were supposed to try out basic JavaScript by creating a pizzeria. By using prompts the user could give their input about different things, like what food they wanted to order. With the input they left we were then supposed to use alerts to confirm the choices the user made.

## The problem

I have found it challenging to understand JavaScript so I had a hard time to even start the project. To try to understand more of JavaScript I have watched videos, turned to chatGPT for explanations, read materials online and watched code sessions and Q & A with our code coach. I found it very valuable to discuss the code and problems with it with a team mate, and that helped me moving forward.
I tried to start with the stretch goals but I struggled to much with it, but that is something that I would give another try if I had more time.

In this project no styling was needed, since the focus was the JavaScript. I do want to have a footer in all my projects with links to my LinkedIn etc. though. Therefore I added a few things, but it went smoothly since I used the same footer as I did in a previous project with a few small adjustments. I needed to add a 1 second timeout for the first alert though, since everything in the footer didn't have time to load otherwise because the alert appeared so fast.
